Topic modellling and sentiment analysis of COVID tweets using Python
We extracted data using Twitter API and collected some 1 million tweets to perform topic modelling. 
Performed LDA unsupervised algorithm to find topics which were frequent among discussion on twitter. topic were not seggregated enough evident from visualization. we deployed semi supervised algorithm for topic modelling using guided LDA and Corex. 
This produced fantastic results. 
after that we used lexicons available with python to classify tweets in sentiments using VADER.
Visualization was performed using Tableau.



You can check the code for semi supervised topic modelling and sentiment analysis in python file.
We downloaded the data using twitter API. any data with twitter text will run fine on this code.
